In JavaScript, `BigInt` is a special numeric type that allows you to represent integers with arbitrary precision. It was introduced in ECMAScript 2020 to handle numbers larger than what can be represented by the `Number` type, which has a maximum safe integer value of `2^53 - 1` (9,007,199,254,740,991).

### 1. **Creating a `BigInt`**

You can create a `BigInt` in two ways:

- By appending `n` to the end of an integer literal.
- By using the `BigInt()` constructor.

#### Example:
```javascript
// Using the 'n' suffix
let bigIntLiteral = 1234567890123456789012345678901234567890n;

// Using the BigInt constructor
let bigIntConstructor = BigInt("1234567890123456789012345678901234567890");

console.log(bigIntLiteral);     // Outputs: 1234567890123456789012345678901234567890n
console.log(bigIntConstructor); // Outputs: 1234567890123456789012345678901234567890n
```

### 2. **Operations with `BigInt`**

`BigInt` supports standard arithmetic operations, but you cannot mix `BigInt` with `Number` types directly. You must convert them to the same type before performing operations.

#### Example:

```javascript
let a = 1000000000000000000000000000000n;
let b = 2000000000000000000000000000000n;

let sum = a + b;
console.log(sum); // Outputs: 3000000000000000000000000000000n

// Mixing BigInt with Number (will cause an error)
let num = 5;
let bigInt = 10n;
// let result = num + bigInt; // TypeError: Cannot mix BigInt and other types

// Correct way to mix
let result = BigInt(num) + bigInt;
console.log(result); // Outputs: 15n
```

### 3. **Comparison with `BigInt`**

`BigInt` can be compared using standard comparison operators like `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`, `==`, and `===`.

#### Example:
```javascript
let bigInt1 = 100n;
let bigInt2 = 200n;

console.log(bigInt1 < bigInt2); // Outputs: true
console.log(bigInt1 == 100n);   // Outputs: true
console.log(bigInt1 === 100n);  // Outputs: true

// Comparison with Number
console.log(bigInt1 == 100);    // Outputs: true (because == does type coercion)
console.log(bigInt1 === 100);   // Outputs: false (because === does not do type coercion)
```

### 4. **`BigInt` Limitations**

- **No floating-point support**: `BigInt` can only represent integers, not floating-point numbers.
- **Cannot mix with `Number` without explicit conversion**: Arithmetic operations between `BigInt` and `Number` are not allowed unless you explicitly convert one type to the other.
- **Precision trade-off**: While `BigInt` allows for arbitrarily large integers, it does not offer the floating-point precision that `Number` provides.

### 5. **Example Use Cases**

- **Cryptography**: `BigInt` is useful for cryptographic algorithms where large integers are common.
- **High-precision calculations**: Situations where precision beyond what `Number` can provide is needed, like certain scientific calculations.
- **Handling large integers**: For applications that need to handle large integers, such as working with large datasets, financial calculations with high precision, etc.
