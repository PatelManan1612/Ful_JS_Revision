### 1. Single-Line Comments

Single-line comments start with `//`. Everything following `//` on that line is a comment and will not be executed by JavaScript.

```javascript
// This is a single-line comment
let x = 10; // This is an inline comment after a statement
console.log(x); // Logs 10 to the console
```

### 2. Multi-Line Comments

Multi-line comments start with `/*` and end with `*/`. They can span multiple lines.

```javascript
/*
This is a multi-line comment.
It can span multiple lines.
Useful for longer explanations or comment blocks.
*/
let y = 20;
console.log(y); // Logs 20 to the console
```
