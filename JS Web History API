The Web History API provides a way to interact with the browser's session history, including navigating back and forth between pages. The History object is part of the Window interface and allows for manipulation of the browser history.

### History Object Properties

1. **`length`**
   - **Description:** Returns the number of entries in the session history for the current tab. This includes the currently loaded page.
   - **Example:**
     ```javascript
     console.log(history.length);
     ```
     This will output the number of URLs in the history stack.

### History Object Methods

1. **`back()`**
   - **Description:** Loads the previous URL in the history list, equivalent to clicking the browser's back button.
   - **Example:**
     ```javascript
     history.back();
     ```
     This will take the user back to the previous page in their history.

2. **`forward()`**
   - **Description:** Loads the next URL in the history list, equivalent to clicking the browser's forward button.
   - **Example:**
     ```javascript
     history.forward();
     ```
     This will take the user forward to the next page in their history.

3. **`go(n)`**
   - **Description:** Loads a specific page from the session history. The parameter `n` can be a positive or negative integer.
     - `n = -1`: Moves back one page.
     - `n = 1`: Moves forward one page.
     - `n = 0`: Reloads the current page.
   - **Example:**
     ```javascript
     // Move back one page
     history.go(-1);

     // Move forward one page
     history.go(1);

     // Reload the current page
     history.go(0);
     ```
     This method allows for precise control over the navigation in the user's history.
